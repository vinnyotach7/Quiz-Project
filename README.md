# The Quiz Board

### Description

The quiz is based on questions with 4 answers. Only one answer is
correct. There are up to 6 questions possible. The sketch below show
a possible design of the board. The buttons could be places within the table area.
One important goal of the project is a simple and lean design. It should be easy
for new and unexperienced developers to get familiar with the code. For this
reason, I try to avoid heavy weight libraries in favour of simple and straight
solutions
## Features

Planned features are:

* stand-alone usage without a PC
* selectable set of *correct answers*
* power-safe mode for running on batteries
* optional observation of the time to answer all questions (timeout)
